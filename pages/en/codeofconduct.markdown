# Code of Conduct 

All participants of the Bioinformatics and Open science Skills events are expected to treat each other with respect and courtesy. All interactions in the online meetups, and workshops should be professional.

To exercise a positive and professional environment we advise our members to practice the following behaviors;

## Expected Behaviour (Dos)
- Be respectful amongst members at all levels of membership.
- Respect different opinions and gracefully accept constructive feedback 
- When handling research projects given by the organizers, always leave room for improvement and invite positive criticism   
- In meetings, members are expected to use welcoming language and encourage interactions among peers.
- Focus on the main goals of the events.
- Contact the organizing committee immediately to report any situation that causes you or other members any kinds of discomfort in the events. There is an option of reporting anonymously and the organizing committee will keep all reports confidential to prevent retaliation.
Violation reports should be sent to this email: bioinformaticshubofkenya@gmail.com. 


## Unaccepted Behavior (Don’ts)

- Verbal or written comments that exclude people on the basis of membership to either community (BHKi or OpenScienceKE) or a specific group.
- Causing members discomfort or fear for their safety especially through stalking, intimidation, harassment or cyber bullying.
- Using harsh or sexual language, racist or inappropriate jokes.
- Sexual or violent display of images or any media content in any event.

## Enforcement
To avoid any situation that breaches our Code of Conduct, we advise our members make posts on our online platforms that are relevant to group aims and activities.  If in doubt as to whether a post to our online platforms (Slack) or community forums pertains to the events, seek approval from the organising committee.

Members who indulge in unacceptable behavior will be summoned personally by a member of the steering committee and will be asked to stop immediately. In case of repeated unacceptable behavior, or serious violation of the code of conduct, the offending member(s) will be suspended from all future events. The suspension can only be revoked by a disciplinary committee during the review of the behavior. In case the outcome is not satisfactory to the member, they are given another chance to appeal their case.

Every member is expected to enforce the code of conduct. Failure to enforce it will be counterproductive. Our members’ welfare is extremely important to us. To ensure this, we invite our participants to uphold our Code of Conduct and help us create a community that is safe and welcoming for everyone. At the end of our events, we will publish a transparency report through the event website.
